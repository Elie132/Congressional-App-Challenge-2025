# Logo Assets

## How to Add Your Custom Logo

1. **Create your logo** as a PNG file
2. **Name it exactly**: `shelfshare.png`
3. **Place it in this folder**: `public/assets/logos/`
4. **Recommended specs**:
   - Format: PNG with transparent background
   - Size: 512x512px or higher (square aspect ratio works best)
   - Style: Clean, modern design that works at small sizes

## File Structure
```
public/
  assets/
    logos/
      shelfshare.png  ← Put your logo here!
      README.md       ← This file
```

## What Happens
- The app will automatically load your `shelfshare.png` file
- If the file doesn't exist, it shows a green "S" fallback
- The logo appears in the header, homepage, and as the favicon

## Tips for Best Results
- Keep it simple - logos need to work at small sizes
- Use high contrast colors
- Square or slightly rectangular shapes work best
- PNG format with transparency is recommended
